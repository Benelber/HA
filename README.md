# Home Assistant Project v. 28.01.2019
Home Assistant Project by Jimmy

Hello everyone, as requested my Home Assistant config.
I hope it can help anyone out.

Disclaimer: I am not a developer, nor a programmer and
have not worked in IT or whatsoever so the code may be 
a big mess (or maybe not), but I wouldn't know because
I don't know what "good" code should look like. Any
custom-component and/or cards are not made by me nor 
can I give support for it!

This UI is built for mobile phones in mind and so the
desktop version might look odd at times. Unfortunately
for some reason my custom:weather-card wont load on any
browser on my pc (my iphone works fine). Sorry for that.

history:

v. 28.01.2019
  - automations.yaml, scenes.yaml, scripts.yaml and
    configuration.yaml added to repository
  - changed some minor details on the lovelace setup
    (some cards are smaller now, navigation buttons
    have a bar now)
  - major change to button-card: this version includes
    a tap and hold action for buttons that work with
    the custom:button-card. You will need the edited
    button-card.js which can be downloaded here.

v. 26.01.2019: 
  - ui-lovelace.yaml, themes.yaml and image files added 
    to repository

# Home Assistant Project v. 26.01.2019
Home Assistant Project by Jimmy

Hello everyone, as requested my Home Assistant config.
For now only my ui-lovelace.yaml will be included and
for the ones looking for it I have also included the 
image files (unfortunately I do not have the originals
anymore so you will have to work around this or use an
image of your own. Oh and I forgot to mention that for
this release I will also include the themes.yaml file 
so you can copy (and/or tweak) this for your own setup.

Disclaimer: I am not a developer, nor a programmer and
have not worked in IT or whatsoever so the code may be 
a big mess (or maybe not), but I wouldn't know because
I don't know what "good" code should look like. I will
try to explain my motives and as to why and how I did
my setup the way I did in the future. But for now I 
hope that these few files could help you out.

This UI is built for mobile phones in mind and so the
desktop version might look odd at times. Unfortunately
for some reason my custom:weather-card wont load on any
browser on my pc (my iphone works fine). Sorry for that.

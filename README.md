# Home Assistant Project v. 28.01.2019
Home Assistant Project by Jimmy

Hello everyone, as requested my Home Assistant config.
I hope it can help anyone out.

Disclaimer: I am not a developer, nor a programmer and
have not worked in IT or whatsoever so the code may be 
a big mess (or maybe not), but I wouldn't know because
I don't know what "good" code should look like. Any
custom-component and/or cards are not made by me nor 
can I give support for it!

This UI is built for mobile phones in mind and so the
desktop version might look odd at times. Unfortunately
for some reason my custom:weather-card wont load on any
browser on my pc (my iphone works fine). Sorry for that.

history:

v. 28.01.2019
  - automations.yaml, scenes.yaml, scripts.yaml and
    configuration.yaml added to repository
  - changed some minor details on the lovelace setup
    (some cards are smaller now, navigation buttons
    have a bar now)
  - major change to button-card: this version includes
    a tap and hold action for buttons that work with
    the custom:button-card. You will need the edited
    button-card.js which can be downloaded here.
  - added xbox custom-component, download this one which
    has the fixed version number (for the ones that get
    errors with the current 'official' one)

v. 26.01.2019: 
  - ui-lovelace.yaml, themes.yaml and image files added 
    to repository


For screenshots look at the screenshots folders (mobile or desktop) if you can't open them on your mobile, check the view on desktop button!!

WARNING! DO NOT JUST COPY/PASTE MY SETUP AS YOU WILL GET ERRORS, YOU WILL GET FRUSTRATED AND I CAN NOT GIVE SUPPORT ON THAT.
INSTEAD CREATE YOUR OWN! GOOD LUCK.
